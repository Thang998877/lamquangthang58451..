Problem: Explain how to display help information on a particular function in a given module.
Solution:
   If you are going to use only a couple of a module’s resources frequently, you can avoid the use of the qualifier
   with each reference by importing the individual resources, as follows:
       from math import pi
       print(pi)
       from math import sqrt
       print(sqrt(2))
    ....
